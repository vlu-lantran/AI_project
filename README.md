## Introduction
This branch is for an A.I. project focused on anomaly detection using the current model Yolov8-Open-ImageV7. The script is designed to detect anomalies in video data, recording the appearance and disappearance times of objects, as well as when an object reappears or disappears again.

## Implemetation:
1. Download the source code from this branch in the repository.
2. Install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.
3. The script has integrated YOLO requirements. If you want to change the YOLO model from Ultralytics, simply download the new model and change the file name in the following line:

```python
parser.add_argument('--weights', type=str, default='yolov8s-oiv7.pt', help='model.pt path(s)')
#Example: default='yolo11n.pt'    
```
Parameters: --weights: Path to the YOLO model weights file (e.g., yolov8s-oiv7.pt).

## Usage
To run the anomaly detection script, use the following command:
```python
#Example
python anomaly_detect_v1.2_group1.py --source sample/sample.mp4
```
Parameters: --source: Path to the video file or webcam stream (e.g., input/video.mp4).
To run the anomaly detection script with real-time detection using camera, use the following command:
```python
#Example
python anomaly_detect_v1.2_group1.py --source 0
```
Parameters: --source: Path to the video file or webcam stream (e.g., input/video.mp4, input/0 to open the camera).
## Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Analyze videos for anomalies, specifically focusing on detecting fluctuations in the environment such as explosions, fires, smoke, and other unusual events.
  
- **Object Behavior Detection**: Specifically track the first object (Object 1) in the video to detect its disappearance, logging the times and occurrences for further analysis.

- **Bounding Boxes**:
  1. **Fluctuation Detection**: Draw bounding boxes around environmental fluctuations (e.g., explosion, fire, smoke). These boxes are indicated in **red** and labeled as "Fluctuation" to distinguish them from tracked objects.
  2. **Object Detection**: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects, specifically focusing on Object 1. These boxes are color-coded based on the status of the object: **green** for "Objects" and **blue** for any anomalies detected.

- **Time Logging**: Log the appearance and disappearance times of similar objects for a comprehensive understanding of their activity in the scene.
- **Real-time Detection**: Log the appearance and disappearance times by using camera with 24 frame per secs.
- **Output**: Generate a video output that visualizes detected anomalies and objects, along with a JSON file summarizing the detection results, including anomaly occurrences and times.

## Libraries Used
1. **argparse**: Parsing command-line arguments.
2. **time**: Time measurement.
3. **json**: Encoding and decoding JSON data.
4. **pathlib**: Provides easy and portable manipulation of file paths across platforms.
5. **cv2**: Image processing and computer vision.
6. **torch**: Neural network processing.
7. **collections.defaultdict**: Class to create default dictionaries where a default value is provided if the key does not exist.
8. **ultralytics.YOLO**: Used to deploy the YOLO object detection model.
9. **Background Substraction**: Use for analyzing anomaly in the environmental fluctuations in the script.
